# Bed Bug Identification App
## Background
There is a Reddit Community called [r/whatsthisbug](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/) where users submit photos of bugs that they wish to be identified. A common question on this community is the "[Is this a bedbug? help!](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/18da4ld/is_this_a_bedbug_help/)" question.
Bedbug questions are so common that there is a seperate community named [bedbugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/) where users constantly ask if a bug is a bedbug, and wait for an "expert" 
Redditor to answer. In fact, as a human after seeing several dozen bedbug photos, most humans are able to classify them at a high rate. For my project, I used Machine Learning to train a model 
that will find patterns from many images (like a human would) and will classify images as having a bedbug (or not having a bedbug).
